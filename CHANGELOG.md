# Changelog

All notable changes to Viewstor are documented here. Format based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/).

## [0.2.5] — 2026-03-30

### Added
- **Get Started welcome page** — shown on first install with connection setup guide, import instructions, and MCP config copy button ([#41](https://github.com/Siyet/viewstor/issues/41))
- **MCP launcher at stable path** — `~/.viewstor/mcp-server.js` auto-updated on each activation, no manual path changes on extension update ([#41](https://github.com/Siyet/viewstor/issues/41))
- **`Viewstor: Setup MCP`** command — modal dialog with ready-to-copy MCP config
- **`Viewstor: Get Started`** command — re-open welcome page anytime
- **"Did you mean?" column suggestions** — on typos in column names (Levenshtein distance ≤ 3), suggests closest match from table schema

### Fixed
- Query errors no longer replace result panel content — shown as VS Code notification instead ([#41](https://github.com/Siyet/viewstor/issues/41))
- Duplicate tables in tree view when same table name exists in multiple schemas — fixed `pg_class` JOIN to filter by namespace
- **Show Table Data** on second database in multi-DB connections — was querying main DB instead of the selected one
- Result panel opens in the main editor group instead of creating a side split
- Error notifications now show the error first, then the SQL query (up to 255 chars)
- All errors logged to Output channel ("Viewstor") for diagnostics

## [0.2.4] — 2026-03-30

### Fixed
- Extension crash on startup: `ssh2` native module not included in `.vsix` package ([#38](https://github.com/Siyet/viewstor/issues/38))
- E2E tests for `getCompletions` updated to match structured `CompletionItem[]` return type

### Added
- Output channel "Viewstor" with activation error notification and "Show Logs" button ([#39](https://github.com/Siyet/viewstor/issues/39))
- E2E tests job in CI pipeline

## [0.2.3] — 2026-03-30

### Added
- Query History click — opens query text + cached results without re-executing ([#4](https://github.com/Siyet/viewstor/issues/4))
- Pin/unpin queries in history — pinned entries never auto-evicted ([#4](https://github.com/Siyet/viewstor/issues/4))
- Configurable history retention: `viewstor.queryHistoryLimit` setting (default 200)
- Clear all / delete single history entries
- Enum value autocomplete after `=`, `!=`, `<>`, `IN` operators ([#32](https://github.com/Siyet/viewstor/issues/32))

- JSON preview with syntax highlighting in cell editor popup
- Show actual executed query (with auto-LIMIT) in progress notification ([#36](https://github.com/Siyet/viewstor/issues/36))
- ClickHouse table sizes in tree view (`~15k rows · 2.3 MB`)

### Changed
- Auto-LIMIT uses max(defaultPageSize, 1000) instead of hard-coded 100
